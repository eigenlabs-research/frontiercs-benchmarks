# Yukon agent trace hook — shared wrapper (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex).
#
# Adapted from each agent's official hook docs + the most-referenced open-source integrations,
# kept intentionally thin (all logic lives in the CLI):
#   - Claude Code hooks (Stop/SessionEnd): https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks
#     technique from Langfuse Claude-Observability-Plugin (MIT):
#     https://github.com/langfuse/Claude-Observability-Plugin
#   - Cursor hooks: https://cursor.com/docs/hooks
#     pattern from naoufalelh/cursor-langfuse (MIT)
#   - Codex hooks: https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks (Stop hook, JSON on stdin)
#
# Changed vs those references:
#   - forwards to Yukon via `frontiercs trace hook <agent>` instead of Langfuse;
#   - parsing/redaction/upload live in the CLI (this stays a one-liner);
#   - credentials come from the CLI config (~/.config), never written into the repo;
#   - silent-fail so it can never block or slow the agent.

# Upload in a detached background process so the hook returns instantly: it never adds latency to a
# turn and is never "cancelled" for outliving the agent's shutdown grace. Fired on every user
# message + turn end, so frequent uploads keep the server's merged transcript current.
