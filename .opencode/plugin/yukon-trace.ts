// Yukon agent trace hook — opencode plugin.
// Adapted from opencode plugin docs (https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins) and the event set in
// @devtheops/opencode-plugin-otel (MPL-2.0, https://github.com/DEVtheOPS/opencode-plugin-otel).
// Changed: instead of emitting OTLP, events are batched and piped to `frontiercs trace hook opencode`,
// which reads creds from the CLI config and uploads to Yukon; silent-fail.
//
// Accumulate every event to a FILE (an in-memory buffer doesn't survive across handler calls, but a
// file does — the factory runs once, cwd is stable). The file is keyed by cwd AND pid so two opencode
// processes in the same repo (e.g. concurrent runs) never share it. On each turn boundary
// (`session.idle`) and at shutdown (`server.instance.disposed`), hand the WHOLE file to the CLI as a
// transcript via a BLOCKING spawnSync, tagged with the root session id so the server keeps one
// per-session object — overwrite semantics, refreshed every turn, exactly like Claude/Codex. (We do
// NOT truncate; the file is the growing session transcript, and it captures sub-agent events too,
// since opencode delivers them on the same bus.) Cleared at session start; creds come from the config.
